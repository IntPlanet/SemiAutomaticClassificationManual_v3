"There are several definitions of **GIS** (Geographic Information Systems), "
"which is not simply a program. In general, GIS are systems that allow for "
"the use of geographic information (data have spatial coordinates). In "
"particular, GIS allow for the view, query, calculation and analysis of "
"spatial data, which are mainly distinguished in raster or vector data "
"structures. Vector is made of objects that can be points, lines or polygons,"
" and each object can have one ore more attribute values; a raster is a grid "
"(or image) where each cell has an attribute value (Fisher and Unwin, 2005). "
"Several GIS applications use raster images that are derived from remote "
"sensing."

"Usually, remote sensing is the measurement of the energy that is emanated "
"from the Earth’s surface. If the source of the measured energy is the sun, "
"then it is called **passive remote sensing**, and the result of this "
"measurement can be a digital image (Richards and Jia, 2006). If the measured"
