"ROIs (Regions Of Interest) are polygons that can be created automatically "
"using a region growing algorithm (i.e. image is segmented around a pixel "
"seed), by clicking on an image pixel. This way, created ROIs include "
"spectrally homogeneous pixels. Alternatively, ROIs can be created manually "
"by drawing a polygon. Created ROIs are temporary polygons, until they are "
"saved in the training shapefile, which are placed inside a group named "
"``Class_temp_group`` , and deleted when the QGIS project is closed."

"ROIs are defined with the Macroclass ID, Macroclass Information (e.g. "

"signatures in the same land cover class."
